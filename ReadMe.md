### Introduction



**Goal of the project:** build a model to predict whether the target variable `income` of an individual is bigger or smaller than $50,000 per year.

**Dataset:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult from the 1994 United States Census Bureau data. The file here is named `income_dataset.csv`



### Methods

The prediction of the income is developed in two different notebooks:

- `Project_Income.ipynb` where traditional machine learning algorithms are used.

- `Project_Income.ipynb` where neural networks are used.

  

### Conclusions

This analysis is useful to train the following skills:

- Data analysis, descriptive statistics and visualization tools.
- Handling of categorical variables.
- Handling of missing values.
- Prediction of classes with an imbalanced dataset.
